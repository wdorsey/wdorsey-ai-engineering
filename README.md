## Study Topics, Projects, and Resources

(bullet-points with exclamation points mean they are a highly-recommended resource)

Make sure what you working on is productive, 80/20 principle

### Programming

- Python - main language of the Data science/AI ecosystem
	- Jupyter Notebooks - install application, do quick intro tutorial or w/e
	- Pandas - data analysis library, do tutorial
	- NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow
	- Matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly
- Go/Rust - backend language preferred for AI Engineering roles
- Neetcode
- Data Analysis Project
	- Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney
	- Find data set to analyze. Look at Kaggle.
	- Import data into Pandas in Jupyter Notebooks
	- Plot variables, look at correlations
	- Make it a professional presentation within Jupyter Notebooks, something to show
